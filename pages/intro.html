		<p>The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is a space telescope that was launched into low Earth orbit in 1990 and remains in operation today. It is one of the most well-known and productive scientific instruments in space, and it has played a crucial role in expanding our understanding of the universe.</p>
		<p><strong>Key Features of the Hubble Space Telescope:</strong></p>
		<ol>
		<li><p><strong>Launch and Location:</strong> The Hubble Space Telescope was launched on April 24, 1990, by the Space Shuttle Discovery. It orbits Earth at an altitude of about 547 kilometers (340 miles), which allows it to capture images and data without the distortion caused by Earth's atmosphere.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The primary purpose of the Hubble is to observe distant stars, galaxies, and other astronomical objects. It has been instrumental in studying the universe's expansion, the age of the universe, and the formation of stars and galaxies.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p><strong>Observation Capabilities:</strong> Hubble is equipped with a suite of instruments that allow it to observe in the ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. This broad range of observation has enabled scientists to study a wide variety of celestial phenomena.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p><strong>Resolution and Clarity:</strong> The Hubble has a high resolution and can capture images with unprecedented clarity. This is due to the absence of atmospheric distortion and the fact that it doesn't suffer from the same limitations as ground-based telescopes, such as light pollution.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p><strong>Maintenance and Upgrades:</strong> The Hubble was designed to be serviced by astronauts, which has allowed for the repair and upgrade of its instruments over the years. This has extended its operational life and kept it at the forefront of astronomical research.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p><strong>Notable Discoveries:</strong> The Hubble has made numerous significant contributions to astronomy, including the discovery of dark energy's role in the acceleration of the universe's expansion, detailed observations of black holes, and the confirmation of the existence of extrasolar planets.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p><strong>Legacy and Successor:</strong> The Hubble's legacy will continue with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which was launched in 2021. While the JWST is designed to observe in the infrared spectrum and will focus on different aspects of the universe, Hubble's contributions to our understanding of the cosmos will remain unparalleled.</p>
		</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The Hubble Space Telescope has been a cornerstone of astronomical research and has provided humanity with a deeper understanding of the universe we inhabit. Its images and data have not only advanced scientific knowledge but have also captured the public's imagination, making it one of the most iconic scientific instruments of our time.</p>
