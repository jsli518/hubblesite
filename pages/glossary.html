		<p>Here are most common glossaries related to the Hubble Space Telescope:</p>
		<ol>
		<li><p><strong>Faint Object Camera (FOC)</strong>: An instrument aboard Hubble that recorded high-resolution images of faint celestial objects in deep space.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p><strong>Faint Object Spectrograph (FOS)</strong>: An instrument on Hubble that separated light from celestial objects into their component colors, providing information about the object's temperature, chemical composition, density, and motion.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p><strong>Far-Infrared Spectrum</strong>: The region of the infrared spectrum with the longest wavelengths and lowest frequencies and energies.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p><strong>Fault</strong>: A geological term for a fracture or break in a hard surface like Earthâ€™s crust, which can be a site of earthquakes or volcanoes.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p><strong>Field of View (FOV)</strong>: The area a telescope can view, measured in degrees, arc minutes, or arc seconds.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p><strong>Filter</strong>: A device that absorbs certain colors of light while allowing others to pass through, used by astronomers to observe celestial objects in specific colors or to reduce the light of bright objects.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p><strong>Filter Wheels</strong>: Rotating wheels in a telescope instrument that allow specific colors of light from a celestial object to pass through and form an image on the detector.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p><strong>Fine Guidance Sensors (FGS)</strong>: Cameras that help keep Hubble pointed precisely by locking onto guide stars and measuring their positions relative to the object being viewed.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p><strong>Fission</strong>: A nuclear process that releases energy when heavy atomic nuclei break down into lighter nuclei, forming the basis of the atomic bomb.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p><strong>Fixed Head Star Trackers (FHST)</strong>: Small telescopes aboard Hubble used with the Fine Guidance Sensors to locate bright stars for orienting the telescope.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p><strong>Heliocentric</strong>: An adjective meaning "centered on the Sun."</p>
		</li>
		<li><p><strong>Hemisphere</strong>: Half of a spherical or roughly spherical body, such as the northern and southern halves of the Earth.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p><strong>Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram</strong>: A plot showing the relationship between the brightness and surface temperatures of many stars.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p><strong>High Speed Photometer (HSP)</strong>: An original instrument on Hubble that made rapid photometric observations of celestial objects in near-ultraviolet to visible light.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p><strong>Host Galaxy</strong>: A galaxy in which a cosmic phenomenon, such as a supernova explosion, has occurred.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p><strong>Hot-Jupiter</strong>: A planet similar to Jupiter, orbiting close to its host star with an orbital period of less than 10 days.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p><strong>Hubble Constant (Ho)</strong>: A number expressing the rate at which the universe expands with time.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p><strong>Hubble's Law</strong>: The idea that the recessional velocities of faraway galaxies are directly proportional to their distance from us.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p><strong>Hubble Space Telescope (HST)</strong>: An orbiting telescope that collects light from celestial objects in visible, near-ultraviolet, and near-infrared wavelengths.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p><strong>Hydrogen</strong>: The lightest and most abundant chemical substance in the universe.</p>
		</li>
		</ol>
