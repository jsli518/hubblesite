		<h3 class="atx" id="limitations-of-the-hubble-space-telescope">Limitations of the Hubble Space Telescope:</h3>
		<ol>
		<li><p><strong>Sensitivity to Radiation</strong>: Hubble is not sensitive to very-high-energy radiation like X-rays and gamma rays, or to low-energy radiation in the mid- and far-infrared or radio regions .</p>
		</li>
		<li><p><strong>Light Collection</strong>: It cannot collect the sheer quantity of light available to larger ground-based telescopes, which is vital for obtaining high-resolution spectra .</p>
		</li>
		<li><p><strong>Gyroscope Limitations</strong>: Hubble has experienced issues with its gyroscopes, which are crucial for pointing and stability. Operating with a reduced number of functional gyros can decrease efficiency and limit the flexibility of observations .</p>
		</li>
		<li><p><strong>Field of View</strong>: While Hubble has a significant field of view for space-based telescopes, it is still limited compared to some ground-based instruments, especially those employing adaptive optics .</p>
		</li>
		<li><p><strong>Atmospheric Absorption</strong>: Although Hubble is above Earth's atmosphere, it cannot view certain wavelengths that are absorbed by the atmosphere, which limits its observational capabilities in some parts of the spectrum .</p>
		</li>
		<li><p><strong>Maintenance and Upgrades</strong>: Hubble was designed for servicing by space shuttles, which are no longer operational, limiting further upgrades and maintenance .</p>
		</li>
		<li><p><strong>Operational Life</strong>: Hubble's operational life is finite, and it is expected to continue operations into the 2020s and possibly into the 2030s, but not indefinitely .</p>
