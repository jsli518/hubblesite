		<p>The history of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is a fascinating tale of scientific ambition, technological challenges, and remarkable achievements. Here's a brief overview of its history:</p>
		<ol>
		<li><p><strong>Conceptual Beginnings</strong>: The idea of a space-based optical observatory can be traced back to just after World War II. In 1946, Lyman Spitzer, a professor at Yale University, wrote a paper titled "Astronomical Advantages of an Extra-Terrestrial Observatory," which argued for the benefits of a space telescope over ground-based observatories.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p><strong>National Academy of Sciences Support</strong>: In 1969, the National Academy of Sciences published "Scientific Uses of the Large Space Telescope," which urged the construction of such an instrument.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p><strong>NASA Involvement</strong>: Wernher von Braun and his team at the Marshall Space Flight Center began looking into the challenges of a space telescope in the 1960s. In 1971, NASA's Acting Administrator, George Low, approved the Large Space Telescope Science Steering Group to conduct feasibility studies.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p><strong>Funding and International Cooperation</strong>: The project faced funding challenges, but with lobbying efforts by NASA and leading astronomers, including Lyman Spitzer and John Bahcall, and the involvement of the European Space Research Organization (ESRO), which later became the European Space Agency (ESA), the project received funding from Congress in 1977.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p><strong>Design and Construction</strong>: In 1978, the grinding of the primary mirror began, and astronauts began training for servicing missions in 1979. The Large Space Telescope was renamed in honor of Edwin Hubble in 1983.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p><strong>Challenger Disaster and Delays</strong>: The Space Shuttle Challenger disaster in 1986 led to a 32-month halt in the space shuttle program, which delayed the launch of Hubble. During this time, additional work was done on the telescope, including improvements to solar panels and computer systems.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p><strong>Launch</strong>: Finally, on April 24, 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope was launched aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery. It was deployed on April 25, 1990, and took its "first light" image on May 20, 1990.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p><strong>Mirror Flaw and Repair</strong>: Shortly after launch, it was discovered that Hubble's primary mirror had a spherical aberration, causing images to be slightly blurred. This issue was corrected during the first servicing mission in 1993 with the installation of the Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) and the replacement of the Wide Field/Planetary Camera with an improved version.</p>
		</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Since its launch, the Hubble Space Telescope has become one of the most scientifically productive and beloved telescopes of all time, providing unprecedented views of the universe and making countless discoveries that have revolutionized our understanding of the cosmos.</p>
