The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) serves a variety of scientific functions that have significantly advanced our understanding of the universe. Here are some of the main functions of the Hubble Space Telescope:

1. **High-Resolution Imaging**: Hubble can capture high-resolution images of celestial objects, free from the distortions caused by Earth's atmosphere. This allows for detailed observations of distant galaxies, stars, and other astronomical phenomena.

2. **Ultraviolet Observations**: Hubble's instruments are sensitive to ultraviolet light, which is largely absorbed by Earth's atmosphere. This enables the study of hot stars, star formation regions, and other high-energy phenomena.

3. **Visible Light Spectroscopy**: Hubble's instruments can split light into its component colors, or spectrum, which provides information about the chemical composition, temperature, and motion of celestial objects.

4. **Infrared Observations**: Some of Hubble's instruments can observe in the infrared part of the spectrum, which is useful for studying cooler objects like planetary disks, dust clouds, and distant galaxies.

5. **Cosmological Studies**: Hubble has been crucial in measuring the expansion rate of the universe, known as the Hubble constant. It has also contributed to the discovery of dark energy, a mysterious force that is causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate.

6. **Exoplanetary Research**: Hubble has observed the atmospheres of exoplanets (planets outside our solar system), providing insights into their composition and potential habitability.

7. **Astrophysical Measurements**: Hubble has been used to measure the masses, sizes, and temperatures of celestial objects, including stars, black holes, and supernovae.

8. **Deep Space Surveys**: Hubble has conducted deep space surveys, such as the Hubble Deep Field and the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, which have revealed thousands of galaxies in small patches of sky, showing the diversity of galaxies throughout cosmic history.

9. **Astrometric Measurements**: Hubble's precision has allowed it to measure the positions of stars and other objects with great accuracy, which is useful for studying the dynamics of the Milky Way and other galaxies.

10. **Time-Domain Astronomy**: Hubble has observed variable stars, supernovae, and other objects that change over time, providing insights into stellar evolution and cosmology.

11. **Solar System Observations**: Although not its primary focus, Hubble has also observed objects within our solar system, including planets, asteroids, and comets, providing detailed images and data about these bodies.

The Hubble Space Telescope's versatility and longevity have made it an invaluable tool for astronomers, and its observations have led to numerous groundbreaking discoveries and a deeper understanding of the universe.
