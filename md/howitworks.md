The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) works through a combination of advanced technology and scientific principles. Here's a simplified explanation of how it operates:

1. **Orbital Position**: Hubble orbits Earth at an altitude of about 547 kilometers (340 miles), which places it above the Earth's atmosphere. This allows it to capture clear images without the distortion caused by atmospheric conditions such as clouds, dust, and light pollution.

2. **Mirror and Optics**: At the heart of Hubble is a 2.4-meter (7.9 feet) diameter mirror made of ultra-smooth glass. This mirror collects light from distant objects and reflects it towards the telescope's instruments. The mirror's shape is parabolic to focus the incoming light into a point.

3. **Instruments**: Hubble is equipped with several instruments that can be changed out by astronauts during servicing missions. These instruments include cameras that take images and spectrographs that analyze the light in terms of its wavelengths (colors). The instruments are sensitive to different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, including ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared light.

4. **Data Collection**: When Hubble observes a celestial object, the instruments collect the light and convert it into electronic signals. These signals are then processed and transmitted back to Earth.

5. **Data Transmission**: The data collected by Hubble's instruments is sent to Earth via radio signals. The telescope communicates with the ground through the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS), which relays the data to receiving stations on Earth.

6. **Data Processing**: Once the data is received on Earth, it is processed by scientists and engineers. The raw data is transformed into images and spectra that can be analyzed. This involves tasks such as calibration, alignment, and enhancement to correct for any instrumental effects and to optimize the data for scientific analysis.

7. **Observation Planning**: Hubble's observations are carefully planned by a team of astronomers and engineers. They schedule the observations based on the positions of celestial objects and the availability of the telescope's time.

8. **Servicing Missions**: Hubble was designed to be serviced by astronauts, which has allowed for the repair of malfunctioning instruments and the installation of new, more advanced instruments over time. This has kept Hubble at the forefront of astronomical research.

9. **Pointing and Stabilization**: Hubble must be precisely pointed at the objects it is observing. It uses a set of gyroscopes and reaction wheels to maintain its orientation and to point with high accuracy. Hubble is also stabilized to minimize the effects of its own motion, ensuring that the images it captures are sharp.

10. **Power Supply**: Hubble is powered by solar panels that convert sunlight into electricity. It stores excess power in batteries for use during the parts of its orbit when it is not in sunlight.

The Hubble Space Telescope's operation is a complex process that involves a combination of advanced engineering, precise pointing and stabilization, and careful data collection and processing. Its ability to observe the universe from space has provided us with a wealth of information about the cosmos.
