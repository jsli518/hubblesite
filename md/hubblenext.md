15. **PLATO (Planetary Transits and Oscillations of stars)**: Scheduled for launch in 2026, PLATO is an exoplanet mission that will operate from the L2 point.

16. **IXPE (Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer)**: Launched in 2021, IXPE uses three identical X-ray telescopes to detect polarized X-rays from extreme cosmic objects.

17. **WISE/NEOWISE (Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared survey Explorer)**: A mission that mapped the entire sky in infrared light and was later tasked with identifying and studying near-Earth objects.

18. **Spektr-RG**: A space telescope that observes X-rays and is designed to create a map of the large-scale structure of the universe.

19. **SPHEREx (Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization and Ices Explorer)**: A mission set to launch in 2024 that will survey the sky in infrared and ultraviolet light.

20. **LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna)**: A planned mission for 2034 that will detect gravitational waves from the heliocentric orbit.

### Limitations of the Hubble Space Telescope:

1. **Sensitivity to Radiation**: Hubble is not sensitive to very-high-energy radiation like X-rays and gamma rays, or to low-energy radiation in the mid- and far-infrared or radio regions .

2. **Light Collection**: It cannot collect the sheer quantity of light available to larger ground-based telescopes, which is vital for obtaining high-resolution spectra .

3. **Gyroscope Limitations**: Hubble has experienced issues with its gyroscopes, which are crucial for pointing and stability. Operating with a reduced number of functional gyros can decrease efficiency and limit the flexibility of observations .

4. **Field of View**: While Hubble has a significant field of view for space-based telescopes, it is still limited compared to some ground-based instruments, especially those employing adaptive optics .

5. **Atmospheric Absorption**: Although Hubble is above Earth's atmosphere, it cannot view certain wavelengths that are absorbed by the atmosphere, which limits its observational capabilities in some parts of the spectrum .

6. **Maintenance and Upgrades**: Hubble was designed for servicing by space shuttles, which are no longer operational, limiting further upgrades and maintenance .

7. **Operational Life**: Hubble's operational life is finite, and it is expected to continue operations into the 2020s and possibly into the 2030s, but not indefinitely .

### Features for the Next Generation Hubble Space Telescope:

1. **Broader Spectral Coverage**: Enhance sensitivity across a broader range of the electromagnetic spectrum, including the mid- and far-infrared regions, to complement Hubble's existing capabilities .

2. **Larger Aperture**: Increase the size of the primary mirror to collect more light, which would improve the resolution and sensitivity of the telescope .

3. **Advanced Gyroscopes**: Incorporate more advanced and reliable gyroscopes to ensure stable and precise pointing, reducing the risk of operational issues like those experienced by Hubble .

4. **Adaptive Optics**: Integrate adaptive optics technology to correct for atmospheric distortion, even in space, to achieve higher resolution images across a broader range of wavelengths .

5. **Servicing Capabilities**: Design the next-generation telescope with modular components that can be easily serviced or replaced, potentially by robotic missions or advanced space telescope service vehicles .

6. **Enhanced Communications**: Improve data transmission capabilities to handle the increased volume of data from more advanced instruments and higher resolution observations .

7. **Extended Operational Life**: Incorporate technologies and designs that extend the operational life of the telescope, ensuring it can continue to make valuable observations for decades .

8. **Collaboration with Other Telescopes**: Design the new telescope to work synergistically with other space and ground-based telescopes, providing a comprehensive view of celestial objects across all wavelengths .

9. **Energy Efficiency**: Improve the power system to enhance energy efficiency, which is crucial for the telescope's instruments and computers, especially as it operates further from Earth or in colder environments .

10. **Autonomous Operations**: Incorporate autonomous operation capabilities that allow the telescope to adapt to changing conditions and continue operations with minimal human intervention .
